<p>"사이트에 이미지를 넣는 방법은 두 가지가 있습니다.  태그를 사용하는 것과
태그에 background-image 속성을 추가하는 것. 두 가지 방법의 차이점과 각각 어떠한 경우에 사용하면 좋은지 설명해보세요."</p>

<p>위의 내용을 설명하기 위해서는 Semantic Web과 Semantic Tag의 이해가 필요한데요.</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Semantic Web</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Semantic(의미론적인) Web(HTML) 은 단순한 코드 형대가 아닌 코드 자체에도 의미가 있어서 사람과 기계가 함께 이해 할 수 있는 웹페이지입니다.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="section-heading">Semantic Tag</h4>

<ul>
	<li>과거에 non-semantic tag e.g., div, span등이 아닌 의미를 명확히 설명하는 semantic tag e.g., form, table, img등이 있다.</li>
</ul>

<h6 class="section-heading">태그는 semantic tag고 background-image는 non-semantic tag인건 알겠는데 어떤 차이가 있는가?</h6>

<pre>background-image는 non-semantic tag라서 기계가 이게 <div> 인지 image인지 알수가 없다 하지만 semantic tag인 <img>를 쓰면 사람도 기계도 이것이 image 인지 알수가 있어서 만약 사람들이 인터넷에 image를 검색을 할때 background-image보단 <img>태그를 쓴 image가 먼저 검색이 된다.</pre>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
