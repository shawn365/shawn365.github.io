<h2 class="section-heading">position 속성</h2>

<p><strong>static</strong> : position 속성을 부여하지 않았을 때 가지는 디폴드 값</p>

<p><strong>relative</strong> : 현재 위치에서 상대적인 offset 속성을 줄 수 있다</p>

<p><strong>absolute</strong> : 부모 중에 static이 아닌 요소의 위치를 기준으로 상대적인 offset 속성을 줄 수 있다, 하지만 현재 위치가 변하는 것은 아니다</p>

<p><strong>fixed</strong> : 브라우저에 대해서 위치를 잡는다. 스크롤에 영향을 받지 않고 고정된 위치를 가진다</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">static</h2>

<p>second의 position을 relative로 변경하고 아래로 10px 오른쪽으로 10px만큼 offset을 주었습니다</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">absolute</h2>
{% include codepen.html hash="BawrRPY" title="Semantic Web과 Semantic Tag" %}
<p>absolute 속성을 주는 순간 z축이 변경되었고 이로 인해서 남은 빈 공간에 third가 채워져 들어갔습니다. 이 때 (x, y) 의 위치는 변하지 않았습니다</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">fixed</h2>
{% include codepen.html hash="poWLPxq" title="Semantic Web과 Semantic Tag" %}
<p>first에 fixed 속성을 주었습니다. 스크롤을 움직여도 똑같은 자리에 있는걸 확인할수 있습니다</p>







<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
